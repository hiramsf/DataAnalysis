# Data Analysis and Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository for data analysis and data science projects! This repository serves as a collection of projects I've worked on as I embark on my journey into the world of data science. Each project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## About Me

I'm Hiram Fernandes, an aspiring data scientist passionate about exploring and deriving insights from data. This repository showcases my projects, demonstrating my skills and growth in the field of data analysis and data science.

## Projects

### Project 1: Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in Berlin

#### Description
This project explores the landscape of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in Berlin, Germany. It utilizes a dataset containing information about EV charging stations, including their locations, operators, public access status, and power capacity. Through data analysis and visualization, the project aims to provide insights into the distribution, density, and accessibility of charging stations across different districts of Berlin.

#### Key Features
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze the distribution of charging stations by district, operator, and public access status.
- **Visualizations:** Generate visual representations, such as maps and charts, to illustrate the spatial distribution and density of charging stations.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigate correlations between the number of charging points and other variables, such as district or operator.
- **Insights:** Provide insights into the availability and accessibility of EV charging infrastructure in Berlin, identifying areas with high and low density of charging stations.

#### Potential Extensions
- **Predictive Modeling:** Forecast future growth and demand for EV charging stations based on historical data and trends.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segment EV users based on usage patterns and preferences to better understand their needs and behaviors.
- **Integration with Real-Time Data:** Incorporate real-time data sources to provide up-to-date information on the availability and status of charging stations.

This project serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, urban planners, EV owners, and enthusiasts interested in sustainable transportation and the transition to electric mobility in Berlin.

#### To ensure proper rendering of the Folium map in the notebook, please view it on nbviewer by following this [link](https://nbviewer.org/github/hiramsf/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Electric_Vehicles/ev_charging_stations_berlin.ipynb). GitHub does not support the rendering of dynamic elements like Folium maps directly in notebooks, but nbviewer provides full compatibility for interactive content, allowing you to experience the map as intended.
